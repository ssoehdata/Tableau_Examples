### Project Aims:
##### My aims for the project were to examine what if any relationships existed in the following:

###### <n1>  2) Did any geographic trends in the data emerge for incidents of piracy?
######  <nl> 3) Are there any observable trends or changes in the number of incidence as a function of time?</nl>
######  <nl> 4) What effects do the data tell us about the crews of the ships attacked.</nl>
