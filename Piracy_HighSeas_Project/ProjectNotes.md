### Notes on the project: 

### Project Aims:
  ### My aims for the project were to examine what if any relationships ###existed in the following:

       1) Were there any visible trends in the types of ships/cargo involved in incidents of piracy?
      2) Are there any geographic trends or "hot spots" of piracy activity?
      3) Are there any observable trends or changes in the number of incidence as a function of time?
      4) What effects do the data tell us about the crews of the ships attacked.
