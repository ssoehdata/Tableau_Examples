#### Project Aims:
##### My aims for the project were to examine what if any relationships existed in the following:
###### <n1>1) Are there any visible trends in the types of ships and cargo in piracy incidents?
###### <n1>2) Did any geographic trends in the data emerge for incidents of piracy?
###### <nl>3) Are there any observable trends or changes in the number of incidence as a function of time?</nl>
###### <nl>4) What do the data tell us about the effects on the crews of the ships attacked?</nl>    

#### Data Set: The data is publicly available (source Data.gov) for Maritime Piracy incidents from 2001 - 2022.
###### File format .csv file
#### Tools and Methods Used:

###### Imported .csv data set, cleaned dataset

#### Data Cleaning: 
###### Extensive cleaning and formatting was required for the data. Examples include:
###### Converting date formats, removing Redundant entries, standardizing names and spellings        

#### Findings:
###### <ul>The majority of incidents from the dataset were of the types: Bulk Carrier, Container Ships, Tankers, General Cargo Ships</ul>
###### <ul>Geographic "hot-spot" higher-risk zones were identified and are observable in the Tableua storyboard.</ul>
###### <ul>A marked increase in activity is seen in the year 2006, as well as in 2011 with the number of incidence remaining roughly consistent until a small decrease was observed in 2021.</ul>
###### <ul> Incidents involving hostages showed an increase in 2006 with a peak in numbers at 2011-2012. With the exception of 2015, when no hostage incidents were reported, the number decreased slightly from 2011 and remained roughly consistent until 2021.</ul>
